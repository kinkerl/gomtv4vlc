==========
I really like the Starcraft-Livestreams of GOMTV(http://www.gomtv.net/) but their GOMPlayer ist not available for Linux. The good news is: they are broadcasting the streams in a protocol the VLC media player understands. This is a program which sets a propper configuration in Firefox and Gnome, transforms the GOMPlayer URLs and opens VLC

In short: You can klick on the "view live"-Urls on gomtv.net and VLC opens!

I really like gomtv and i dont want to steal gomplayer users in any way but the gomtv livestream is at the moment only watchable by nerds and geeks if the the gomplayer is not installed. as a result of this, gomtv4vlc is supporting(!) gomtv to be available non-windows systems.
